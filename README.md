## Forewords
Hi, I'm Tam and this is a show case of my data-analytic project for __KPMG Virtual Internship program__.

In this repo, you should find:
- The source code (Jupyter notebook file with annotations of my learning progress)
- The slides for my presentation
- My Power BI Interactive Dashboard

## Overview
The main goal was to identify  1000 high-value customers based on 3 labelled datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions hitory) given by the client.

The internship has 3 modules:
>- Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
- Module 2: Analyzing data to build recommendation for client's marketing strategy
- Module 3: Data Insights and Presentation (using dashboards)

Although the task can be purely done in excel, I would like to challenge myself and complete the task in a Pythony manner.

### Tools that I used:

Environment: Miniconda <br>
Language: Python <br>
Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook <br>
