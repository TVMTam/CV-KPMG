## Forewords
Hi, I'm Tam and this is a show case of my data-analytic project for __KPMG Virtual Internship program__.

In this repo, you should find:
- The source code (Jupyter notebook file with annotations of my learning progress). View it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TVMTam/CV-KPMG/blob/master/Source%20Code%20Notebook.ipynb)
- The [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OXXtSw-_9pQekzz4L1Jv4qIS9urTWf5W/view?usp=sharing) for my presentation
- My Power BI Interactive Dashboard
- [Raw data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rzuxLALY51nqHbDxcZnUyYtOHGlVs8_m/view?usp=sharing) and [Post processed data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_-ZoH60SOg2wEmyV9oAWXHO9rmZlOhdC/view?usp=sharing) in data folder

## Overview
The main goal was to identify  1000 high-value customers based on 3 labelled datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions hitory) given by the client.

The internship has 3 modules:
>- Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
>- Module 2: Analyzing data to build recommendation for client's marketing strategy
>- Module 3: Data Insights and Presentation (using dashboards)

Although the task can be purely done in excel, I would like to challenge myself and complete the task in a Pythony manner.

I've learnt a lot in terms of data manipulation and visualisation. Check out my notebook above for more details.

## Tools that I used:

Environment: Miniconda, Jupyter Notebook<br>
Language: Python <br>
Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib<br>
