# Forewords
Hi, I'm Tam and this is a show case of my data-analytic project for my virtual internship at KPMG.
In this repo, you can find:
- The source code (Jupyter notebook file)
- The slide for my presentation
- My Power BI Interactive Dashboard

## Overview
The goal was to identify  1000 high-value customers based on 3 labelled datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) given by the client.

There are 3 modules:
- Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
- Module 2: Analyzing data to build recommendation for client's marketing strategy
- Module 3: Data Insights and Presentation (using dashboards)

Although the task can be purely done in excel, I would like to challenge myself and complete the task in a Pythony manner.

### Tools that I used:
Language: Python
Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
